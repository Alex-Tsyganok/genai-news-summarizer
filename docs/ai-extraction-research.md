# AI-Supported News Extraction Research

## Overview

This document examines whether adding AI-supported extraction capabilities would enhance our news summarizer pipeline's robustness and accuracy. The research evaluates different approaches, trade-offs, and implementation strategies for integrating AI into the article extraction process.

## Research Objective

Determine if AI-powered extraction should supplement or replace the current tool-based extraction pipeline (newspaper3k → BeautifulSoup fallback) to improve success rates and content quality.

## Current Extraction Analysis

### Existing Architecture

```text
URL → newspaper3k → BeautifulSoup fallback → Article object
```

### Strengths of Current Tool-Based Approach

1. **Performance**: Very fast extraction (~1-2 seconds)
2. **Cost Efficiency**: No API costs for extraction
3. **Reliability**: Deterministic parsing with predictable failure modes
4. **Offline Capability**: Works without external AI service dependencies
5. **Battle-Tested**: Mature libraries handle edge cases well
6. **Resource Efficient**: Low memory and CPU usage

### Current Limitations

1. **Dynamic Content**: Struggles with JavaScript-heavy sites and SPAs
2. **Complex Layouts**: May miss content in non-standard HTML structures
3. **Paywall Content**: Limited ability to handle subscription sites
4. **Content Quality**: May extract navigation, ads, or boilerplate along with articles
5. **Modern Web**: Difficulty with sites using advanced frontend frameworks
6. **Success Rate**: ~95% extraction success, 5% complete failures

## AI Enhancement Approaches

### Approach 1: AI as Content Cleaner (Hybrid Enhancement)

**Architecture:**

```text
URL → tool extraction → AI content cleaning → Article object
```

**Process:**

1. Standard tool-based extraction runs first
2. AI reviews extracted content for quality and completeness
3. AI removes boilerplate, ads, navigation elements
4. AI enhances article metadata (better title extraction, author detection)

**Benefits:**

- Improves content quality for all articles
- Maintains fast extraction with AI polish
- Reduces false positives (extracting non-article content)
- Enhanced metadata accuracy

**Drawbacks:**

- High API costs (every article processed)
- Potential for AI to remove legitimate content
- Processing time increases to 3-5 seconds per article

### Approach 2: AI as Primary Extractor

**Architecture:**

```text
URL → scrape raw HTML → AI extraction → Article object
```

**Process:**

1. Fetch raw HTML content from URL
2. AI analyzes entire page structure and content
3. AI extracts title, author, date, content with context understanding
4. Tool-based methods serve as validation only

**Benefits:**

- Superior handling of complex layouts
- Better context understanding
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content through AI reasoning
- More accurate content-noise separation

**Drawbacks:**

- Very high API costs
- Slower processing (5-10 seconds per article)
- Still can't access JavaScript-rendered content without additional tools
- Requires larger context windows (more expensive)

### Approach 3: AI as Smart Fallback (Recommended)

**Architecture:**

```text
URL → tool extraction → quality check → [if fails] → AI extraction → Article object
```

**Process:**

1. Standard tool-based extraction attempts first
2. Quality assessment algorithm evaluates extraction success
3. If extraction fails or quality is poor, trigger AI extraction
4. AI uses raw HTML to extract article content with structured prompts

**Quality Assessment Criteria:**

- Content length < 200 characters → likely failure
- High ratio of common boilerplate words → poor quality
- Missing title or date → incomplete extraction
- Presence of navigation/menu text patterns → contaminated content

**Benefits:**

- Cost-effective (AI only for ~3-5% of articles)
- Maintains fast processing for successful extractions
- Significantly improves overall success rate
- Preserves all benefits of tool-based approach

**Drawbacks:**

- Additional complexity in error handling
- Need to develop quality assessment algorithm
- Slight latency increase for failed extractions

## Technical Implementation

### Quality Assessment Algorithm

```python
def assess_extraction_quality(article):
    """
    Evaluate if tool-based extraction was successful
    Returns: (success: bool, quality_score: float, issues: list)
    """
    issues = []
    quality_score = 1.0
    
    # Content length check
    if len(article.text) < 200:
        issues.append("Content too short")
        quality_score -= 0.4
    
    # Boilerplate detection
    boilerplate_ratio = detect_boilerplate_content(article.text)
    if boilerplate_ratio > 0.3:
        issues.append("High boilerplate content")
        quality_score -= 0.3
    
    # Essential fields check
    if not article.title or len(article.title) < 10:
        issues.append("Missing or inadequate title")
        quality_score -= 0.2
    
    if not article.publish_date:
        issues.append("Missing publication date")
        quality_score -= 0.1
    
    # Navigation/menu content detection
    nav_indicators = ['menu', 'navigation', 'subscribe', 'cookie', 'advertisement']
    nav_content = sum(1 for indicator in nav_indicators if indicator in article.text.lower())
    if nav_content > 3:
        issues.append("Contains navigation/menu content")
        quality_score -= 0.2
    
    success = quality_score >= 0.6
    return success, quality_score, issues
```

### AI Extraction Implementation

```python
async def ai_extract_article(url, html_content):
    """
    Use AI to extract article content from raw HTML
    """
    system_prompt = """
    You are an expert web content extractor. Extract the main article content from HTML.
    
    Return a JSON object with these fields:
    {
        "title": "Article title",
        "author": "Author name (if available)",
        "publish_date": "Publication date (if available)",
        "content": "Main article text, cleaned of navigation and ads",
        "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of the article",
        "confidence": 0.95
    }
    
    Focus on:
    - Main article content only
    - Remove navigation, ads, comments, related articles
    - Preserve paragraph structure
    - Extract metadata accurately
    """
    
    user_prompt = f"""
    Extract the main article content from this HTML:
    
    URL: {url}
    
    HTML Content:
    {html_content[:8000]}
    """
    
    try:
        response = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
            ],
            temperature=0.1,
            max_tokens=2000
        )
        
        result = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
        
        # Validate AI extraction
        if result.get('confidence', 0) < 0.7:
            raise ValueError("AI extraction confidence too low")
        
        if len(result.get('content', '')) < 100:
            raise ValueError("AI extracted content too short")
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"AI extraction failed for {url}: {e}")
        return None
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Current Costs
